## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* .NET 9 SDK
* Azure account with OpenAI service deployed
* FFmpeg installed on the server
* Ollama installed for local LLM processing

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vicperdana/SemantiClip.git
   ```

2. Install Ollama
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ollama
   
   # Windows

   ```

3. Configure Ollama Model
   ```bash
   # Start the Ollama service
   ollama serve

   # In a separate shell Pull the phi4-mini model (search other models at [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search))
   ollama run phi4-mini
   ```

4. Install FFmpeg
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ffmpeg
   
   # Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
   
   # Windows
   # Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and add to PATH
   ```

5. Configure Azure OpenAI Services
   - Set up Azure OpenAI service
   - Deploy Whisper model for transcription (recommended: whisper)
   - Deploy GPT-4o model for content generation (recommended: gpt-4o)
   - Add your API keys and deployment names to the configuration

6. Configure Appsettings.Development.json
   ```json
   {
     "AzureOpenAI": {
       "Endpoint": "your-azure-openai-endpoint",
       "ApiKey": "your-azure-openai-api-key",
       "DeploymentName": "your-deployment-name"
     },
     "Ollama": {
       "Endpoint": "http://localhost:11434",
       "Model": "phi4-mini"
     }
   }
   ```

7. Run the application
